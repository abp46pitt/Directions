# CPU
The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is one of five core components of a computer. It is known as the brain of the computer and it is what performs most or all, depending on a specific PC's configuration, of the processing. There are two mounting methods for both AMD and Intel CPU's, but this guide will cover the Intel method. 

## Instructions

  1. Have both the compatible CPU and motherboard prepared by placing them on an antistatic work environment. The box that the motherboard came in makes for a great and free option. 
  2. Looking at the motherboard, identify the CPU socket which is between the RAM DIMM slots and the rear IO panel.
  3. Push the lever,present on the right side of the socket, down and away from the socket. This will release the socket cover.
  4. Do not remove the plastic piece that is secured between the metal cover and the socket.
  5. Carefully grab the CPU and identify the very small gold triangle present on the top of one of the four corners. When handling a CPU, it is very important that there is no contact between skin and the CPU underside. 
  6. Depending on the motherboard mannufacturer, identify a similar triangle or dot on one of the four corners of the socket on the motherboard.
  7. Very gently lay the CPU in the motherboard socket with the CPU's gold triangle corner in the same corner as the triangle or dot in the socket that was previously identified. 
  8. Give the CPU a very tiny wiggle from side-to-side to verify that it is properly seated in the socket.
  9. Flip the metal cover over the CPU and align it with the peg that was previously locking it into place.
  10. Push the metal lever back down and in to it's original position. There will be significantly more tension than there was in step 3. 
  11. Once the plastic cover piece pops out of place, place it in a secure place. If there is ever a need to RMA the motherboard, this piece will be required for shipping.
